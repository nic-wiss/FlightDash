FlightDash is an application oriented Senior Capstone Project, created by Nicholas Wissinger, a current CIS Senior at Shepherd University.
The purpose of this application is to showcase my ability for software development, specifically Desktop based application development utilizing Electron.

FlightDash, at its core, is a simulated flight booking application centered on the Desktop of a users device. The application makes use of a combination of
[AmericanAirlines/Flight-Engine](https://github.com/AmericanAirlines/Flight-Engine) and [AmericanAirlines/AA-Mock-Engine](https://github.com/AmericanAirlines/AA-Mock-Engine)
components, which I customized to fit the backend of my application. A huge thanks goes out to American Airlines and their projects.

## Run Locally

To run the app and customize it to your liking, or to explore the files and functionality of the app, there are a few requirements.

* Ensure Node.js (and npm) are installed on your computer
* Open up project directory in preferred shell (Git Bash was used to make the project)
* Run 'npm install' to install dependencies, including Electron
* For the backend to work, you need to install [Flight-Engine](https://github.com/AmericanAirlines/Flight-Engine) as well (NOTE: I will be releasing a fork of the Flight-Engine project with my custom changes to it soon.)
* Run 'npm start' to load into the application you can use 'Cmd-Shift-I' to explore the elements and CSS of the app.
* Have fun!
